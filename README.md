# GithubSaver

Use github as a place for backing up files and data.

## Getting Started

### From source

1. Make a github repo where you would like to save the files to

2. Clone that repo to the local machine and copy the files within /src to this folder

3. Run the scheduler.py file

4. To configure how the program runs edit the config.json file "python" is the python path, "interval" is the interval between backups in seconds
